<p>To start this week, I fixed the issues that I had previously based on the comments of my last submission. Thank you very much for the feedback. </p>

  After that was done, I began the assignment. To start, I created an FAQ page. My questions were a little different than the average business FAQs, 
but I have seen other crochet businesses have to address a few of the questions that I addressed on there such as commissions. 
  Most of the rest of the assignment was easy enough after reading the slides and visiting the book. However, I hit a bump in the road with the buttons for the tools page. 
  When I go to clear it it is comming up as page not found, so I am not sure what is going on there.

<p>Excited to read the feedback for this assignment.</p>
