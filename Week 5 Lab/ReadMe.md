<h2>Week 5 Summary</h2>
<p>  
  We did a lot to our business web app this week. We added some layout changes to the home page. We also created an about page. And finally we added a contact page. 
  I could not get my contact page to load. I did try reading outside sources but could not find anything to figure it out. I belive my issue is with the ContactContollers. 
  I would appreciate any helpful advise as to what I was doing wrong!
