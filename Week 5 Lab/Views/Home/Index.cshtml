        This web application will be a retail web application that allows customers to view and purchase my crochet creations. 
        It will be called “Violet’s Loops.” I have been crocheting for the last 10 years, and have been told by so many people 
        that I should sell some of the items that I have made.
        </div>

        <div class="col-sm">
            There will be a range of products that I have learned how to make, from bags, to stuffed animals. I am always learning new patterns.You never know what the next item will be!
