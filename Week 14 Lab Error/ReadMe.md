<p> In this week's lab, I started by adding the NuGet packages, as well as running the commands to install the EF Core package. I then added a new int field to the ContactModel class named ContactId with the [key] attribute. I also added a few validations to other fields in the ContactModel. After that, I created a new Data folder, added the DbContext class (VioletsLoopsContext.cs) to said folder, and added the directive to include the Models folder in the DbContect class. I went from there and added the links to the navbar for the ProductModels and ContactModels. I used the scaffolding tool to create CRUD pages for the ProductModels and ContactModels. After this, we go into using the Core Migrations feature and this is where I ran into an issue with the SQL server, and had to end this week's lab.  </p>

<p>Thank you again for trying to help me get through this. It is unfortunate that I could not complete this lab. I just kept the folder and the files that I had uploaded when I originally reached out for help, as I donâ€™t believe that I have changed anything since then. </p> 
</br> 
<p> As we discussed in our session, I will use the lab files from week 11 for the continuation of lab 16.
