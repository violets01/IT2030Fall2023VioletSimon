<p> In this week's lab, I started by adding the NuGet packages, as well as running the commands to install the EF Core package. I then added a new int field to the ContactModel class named ContactId with the [key] attribute. I also added a few validations to other fields in the ContactModel. After that, I created a new Data folder, added the DbContext class (VioletsLoopsContext.cs) to said folder, and added the directive to include the Models folder in the DbContect class. I went from there and added the links to the navbar for the ProductModels and ContactModels. I used the scaffolding tool to create CRUD pages for the ProductModels and ContactModels. After this, we go into using the Core Migrations feature and this is where I ran into an issue with the SQL server, and had to end this week's lab. </p>
