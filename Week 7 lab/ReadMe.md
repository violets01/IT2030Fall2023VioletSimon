  This week we added a products page to our application. I was excited to do this step of this project. 
  We added 6 different listings onto our products page as well as a link to view the details of each product individually. I did run into an issue however 
  where the information is not displayed on the details page. I am unsure what the issue is, and I watched the video several times to see if I had made a mistake,
  but I cannot find where the issue is.

<p>Additionally, I saw your comment on my last submission about the contact page not working and I did fix my issue. Thank you very much for the feedback on that.</p>
