<h2>Week 16 responses.</h2>
<ol>
  <li>List 3 things that you learned in this class:
    <ol>
      <li>MVC Architecture: ASP.Net Core MVC separates a web application into 3 components: Model, which represents the data. 
        View that displays the user interface. And finally, the Controller, which handles input and the flow of data between 
        the Model and the View. </li>
      <li>Razor Pages: This feature allows developers to create a web page using a combination of HTML and C#. It makes the process of 
        development much simpler and easier to maintain. </li>
      <li>Entity Framework Core: This framework provided by Microsoft enables developers to work with databases using OO techniques. 
        This takes away the need to write raw SQL queries. Making me question why I spent weeks of my life learning how to write them. </li>
    </ol>
  <li>List three features that can be added to your application to improve the application for users.
    <ol>
      <li>Search bar: As this page grows, more and more products and other pages will get added to the application. I believe that a search bar 
        would tremendously improve the user experience. </li> 
      <li>Live chat: I am sure with such a small business, this would never be necessary or really achievable, but I think that Live Chat is a great feature for a bigger business with a large customer base. I know I personally love live chat when I visit a website and have a question or concern. </li>
    </ol>
  <li>Add one of the features listed above to the application. 
    <ol>
    <li>I decided to add a search bar to the navbar. As the web app grows, I feel that this would be very helpful for users. This can be found: Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml. </li>
    </ol>
  <li>Make 4 style updates to the application: 
    <ol>
    <li>Changed the font family of the body to monospace to: views/contact/index.cshtml, views/shared/ _Layout.cshtml, and views/home/index.cshtml. This effectively changes all fonts on the web application to be monospace. </li>
      <li>Took out the bootstrap background color of navbar and changed it to be a more pink color. I felt that this blended a little better with the header image.</li>
      <li>I noticed that the h4 headers that I had on the contact page had a larger font that the h1 header, so I changed it so that they were smaller. Also added a background color to the h4 elements to make them stand out a little more. I felt like this made it a little easier to read. views/contact/index.cshtml </li>
      <li>Added a background color to the footer to make it match the navbar. views/shared/_Layout.cshtml</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
