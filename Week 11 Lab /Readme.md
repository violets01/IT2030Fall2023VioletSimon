This week we added some data validation to a few parts of our website. We did this to the ContactModel and the ProductModel. We have not been able to test it in this weeks lab.
I am looking forward to testing it in a future lab to ensure that I did it correctly.

  We also created an events page. I very much enjoyed this part of the lab. I did use real events that are currently happening in the crochet community. I made sure to include links
  to the homepage to each of the events I added to my web application.

The last thing I did was look at the rubric for the previous lab and tried to ammend previous mistakes. However, I did as you suggested for the clear session method, and it still
  is comming up as page not found. Unsure what the issue is, but I even copied and pasted to see if I was typing something wrong, and nothing I did fixed the issue.

As always I am looking forward to the feedback for this weeks lab.
