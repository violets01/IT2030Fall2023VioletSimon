<p> This web application will be a retail web application that allows customers to view and purchase my crochet creations. It will be called “Violet’s Loops.” I have been crocheting for the last 10 years, and have been told by so many people that I should sell some of the items that I have made. 
There will be a range of products that I have learned how to make, from bags, to stuffed animals. I am always learning new patterns. You never know what the next item will be! </p>
